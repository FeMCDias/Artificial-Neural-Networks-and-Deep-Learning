## Overview

This project implements a deep learning classification system using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built from scratch with NumPy. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the Bank Marketing Dataset.

## Key Features

- **From-scratch MLP implementation** using only NumPy
- **Early stopping** and regularization techniques
- **Comprehensive evaluation** with ROC-AUC and PR-AUC metrics
- **Detailed analysis** of training dynamics and overfitting behavior
- **Complete documentation** with step-by-step implementation guide
